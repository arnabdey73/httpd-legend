# Location and name of the configuration file, location from the Apache root.

# Location and name of the log file, location from the Apache root.
DispatcherLog /var/www/apache2_logs/dispatcher.log

# Log level for the log file:
# 0 - Errors
# 1 - Warnings
# 2 - Infos
# 3 - Debug
# Note: It is recommended to set the log level to 3 during installation and testing, then to 0 when running in a production environment.
DispatcherLogLevel 3

# Defines the Server Header to be used:
# undefined or 0 - the HTTP server header contains the CQ version.
# 1 - the Apache server header is used
DispatcherNoServerHeader 1

# Defines whether to decline requests to the root "/":
# 0 - accept requests to /
# 1 - requests to / are not handled by the dispatcher; use mod_alias for the correct mapping.
DispatcherDeclineRoot 0

# Defines whether to use pre-processed URLs:
# 0 - use the original URL passed to the web server.
# 1 - the dispatcher uses the URL already processed by the handlers that precede the dispatcher (i.e. mod_rewrite) instead of the original URL passed to the web server.
# See the Apache web site documentation for information about mod_rewrite; for example, Apache 2.2. When using mod_rewrite, it is advisable to use the flag 'passthrough|PT' (pass through to next handler) to force the rewrite engine to set the uri field of the internal request_rec structure to the value of the filename field.
DispatcherUseProcessedURL 1

# Defines how to support 40x error codes for ErrorDocument handling:
# 0 - the dispatcher spools all error responses to the client.
# 1 - the dispatcher does not spool an error response to the client (where the status code is greater or equal than 400), but passes the status code to Apache, which e.g. allows an ErrorDocument directive to process such a status code.
DispatcherPassError 0
